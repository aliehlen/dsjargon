## Data science jargon quiz

### Basics

**Group number:** 2

**Names of all group members:**
Monica
Dale
Lindsay
Lin

### What is the difference between these terms?

**Data analyst vs data engineer vs data scientist:** 
Data analyst - An person who analyzes data to help companies make decisions 
Data engineer - An engineer who prepares/cleans data for later analysis
Data scientist - A person who is responsible for the analysis and communication of the data 

**Machine learning vs deep learning:** 
Machine learning is a broad field of statistical learning for finding trends in data, and one of the methods is deep learning, which utilizes multi-layer artificial neural networks.

**Back end vs front end:** 
Back end - data structures and information storage and setting up servers and, people don't see this work directly
Front end - user interface, GUI, website design, support, interacts through interface with consumers

**Data vs big data (how big is big?):** 
Big data is really hard to define, it's a loose definition that people disagree on. We say big data is "big" enough that statistics work well.

**Supervised vs unsupervised machine learning:** 
Supervised - given known inputs, find the output. You give examples to show it what you want it to learn
Unsupervised - identifies some trend or pattern within the data without specific guidance. There's no shown examples

### Provide the long form of the acronym and a brief definition.

**ETL:** extract, transform, load. Read the data, clean or scale the data, then write the data to be ready for modeling

**EDA:** exploratory data analysis. We want to know about the data and what it describes, and we create plots to visualize trends in the data so we can understand it better

**SQL:** Structured Query Language. Used as a database management system

**PCA:** Principle Component Analysis. A method for dimensionality reduction that still hopes to maintain the variance of the data

**NLP:** Natural Language Processing. Understanding speech and language

### Define

**Tidy data:** It's clean and ready to use data, no NANs

**Fuzzy logic:** Non-boolean logic, [0, 1], it's own branch of logical operations

**Feature engineering:** Coming up with new ways to featurize your data, selecting relevant and non-repetitive features

**Greedy algorithm:** An algorithm that strives to maximize its own short-term goal, doesn't look further in the future for rewards

**K-means cluster:** Unsupervised learning, separates data into k clusters

**Random forest:** supervised learning algorithm employing multiple decision trees

**Lazy evaluation:** waits to evaluate the logic until it actually needs to be computed
