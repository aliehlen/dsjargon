## Data science jargon quiz

### Basics

**Group number:** 3

**Names of all group members:** Igor, Eve, Elodie

### What is the difference between these terms?

**Data analyst vs data engineer vs data scientist:** engineer deals with data structures (storing, cleaning, saving), data analyst analyzes the data (making plots) and makes decisions based on the data, data scientist extracts meaningful conclusions from the data and makes predictions

**Machine learning vs deep learning:** Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, deep learning focuses on unsupervised machine learning while machine learning is more broad

**Back end vs front end:** front end is focused on presenting the data while on the back end you use the software and code to compile the data needed to present on the front end

**Data vs big data (how big is big?):** Big data is complex data that has a lot of components that cannot be handled with traditional methods. If you track many properties over time, you'll lead yourself to a big data regime.

**Supervised vs unsupervised machine learning:** supervised learning relies on prior knowledge determining what the true answer should be, while unsupervised learning lacks initial labeling 

### Provide the long form of the acronym and a brief definition.

**ETL:** extract, transform, load - the process of extracting data from another source, transforming it into your desired data format, and loading it into your database

**EDA:** exploratory data analysis - exploring data with visualizations

**SQL:** structured query language - programming language for data storage and management

**PCA:** principal component analysis - selecting the optimal orthogonal features (bases) to describe our data; can be incorporated into feature engineering

**NLP:** natural language processing - speech recognition, machine learning with language

### Define

**Tidy data:** clearly structured data tables, each variable forms a column while each observation forms a row

**Fuzzy logic:** Logic that isn't fully binary, but instead is represented by some real value between 0 and 1

**Feature engineering:** use outside knowledge to select features for efficient machine learning

**Greedy algorithm:** algorithm that makes the optimal choice at each step, often leads to a local minimum instead of a global minimum

**K-means cluster:** clustering data into different categories based on the distance away from some specified set of feature parameters, unsupervised machine learning method

**Random forest:** make several decision trees which all give different predictions, then aggregate the results and consider the mode of many decision trees to make predictions

**Lazy evaluation:** delays evaluating a problem or assigning a value to a variable until it is needed for a later step in the computation
