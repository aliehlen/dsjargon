## Data science jargon quiz

### Basics

**Group number:** 4

**Names of all group members:** Danielle, Cole, Dawning

### What is the difference between these terms?

**Data analyst vs data engineer vs data scientist:** A data analyst interprets data, a data engineer optimizes and applies algorithms, a data scientist implies someone that designs algorithms.

**Machine learning vs deep learning:** Deep learning uses neural network and is under the umbrella of machine learning. 

**Back end vs front end:** Front end is the user interface and the back end is the infrastructure.

**Data vs big data (how big is big?):** Data can fit on a personal laptop, big data can't. Big data refers to a higher volume or level of complexity (defined by the 4 Vs).

**Supervised vs unsupervised machine learning:** In the supervised case, important variables are specified by the programmer and in unsupervised machine learning, the variables are determined by the algorithm.

### Provide the long form of the acronym and a brief definition.

**ETL:** Extract, Transform, Load - Database functions for moving data between databases.

**EDA:** Exploratory Data Analysis - Seeing what the data means beyond the model.

**SQL:** Standardized Query Language - used for working with databases

**PCA:** Principal Component Analysis - a transformation used to separate correlated variables into uncorrelated variables.

**NLP:** Natural Language Processing - field within machine learning for recognizing, analyzing and generating human language.

### Define

**Tidy data:** Data that has been cleaned up from raw that is ready for analysis.

**Fuzzy logic:** Using the continuous range from 0 and 1 rather than binary logic.

**Feature engineering:** Defining features in machine learning.

**Greedy algorithm:** Not efficient, uses a lot of hardware resources.

**K-means cluster:** A classification scheme using the mean of k-number of clusters.

**Random forest:** A series of decision trees that are very small individually but overall gives you robust results.

**Lazy evaluation:** Delaying evaluation until that evaluation is necessary.
