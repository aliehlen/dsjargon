## Data science jargon quiz

### Basics

**Group number:** 1

**Names of all group members:** Candice, Ally, Suman

### What is the difference between these terms?

**Data analyst vs data engineer vs data scientist:** They have an increasing level of complexity. Somewhat different job requirments and functions.

**Machine learning vs deep learning:** Deep learning various different layers of machine learning algorithms

**Back end vs front end:** Front end for consumers, user interface, back end is coding.

**Data vs big data (how big is big?):** Smaller data sets you could analyze without a computer.

**Supervised vs unsupervised machine learning:** Supervised when you know what the answer is going to be, the output is known, but unsupervised the output is unknown.

### Provide the long form of the acronym and a brief definition.

**ETL:** extract, transform, load, Pulls out data from one data base to put it into the other.

**EDA:** Exploratory data analysis. Summarizing data to know about its main characteristics.

**SQL:** Structured query language. Used to update data on a database.

**PCA:** Principle component analysis. Makes data easy to explore and visualize by finding the principle components of a dataset.

**NLP:** Natural language processing. Allows analysis of human language.

### Define

**Tidy data:** A standard way of mapping a dataset to its structure.

**Fuzzy logic:** Degrees of truth as opposed to a binary true/false kind of thing.

**Feature engineering:** Using some info from data to make machine learning work.

**Greedy algorithm:** Always makes the most optimal choice.

**K-means cluster:** unsupervised machine learning algorithm with a cluster of points that share some similarities.

**Random forest:** Classification method to help you make decisions, regressions., and other stuff that operates by having multiple decisions/

**Lazy evaluation:** A strategy that only evaluates an expression when it is needed and avoids repeating things.
